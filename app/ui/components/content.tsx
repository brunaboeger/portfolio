          I gratuated from the university of Univille in 2014. I have been
          working since then as a UX/UI Designer. Recently, I had the
          opportunity to play a role as a junior frontend developer and I pretty
          much loved it.

        <p className="text-body margin-top-2">
          Design offered me the opportunity to learn a lot about user experience
          and user interface. I was able to work with a wide range of tools and
          technologies, such as Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator and more.

          But something was missing. And what I have been looking for I found in
          web development: the ability to create beautiful and functional
          interfaces that are easy to use and navigate <em>for real</em>.

          and development is always evolving. So many new things are coming. And
          so many to explore.
