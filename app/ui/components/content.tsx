        <p className="paragraph mt-4">
          I gratuated in Graphic Design from the university of Univille in 2017
          and have been working in this field since then as a UX/UI Designer.
          Recently, at the beggining of this year, I had the opportunity to play
          a role as a junior frontend developer and I pretty much loved it. üòç
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph mt-4">
          Design offered me the opportunity to learn deeply about user
          experiences and interfaces, and how to manage them according to the
          users needs and feels. I was able to work with a wide range of tools
          and technologies, such as Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator and more.
        </p>
        <p className="paragraph mt-4">
          Although I am passionate about creating new experiences through
          graphic designs, I must say that I have become enamoured with the
          possibility to build it with my bare hands - literally. Working in web
          development and being close to developers and their workspaces has
          made me acquire valuable knowledge which I can apply in any project.
          And what I have learned so far you can check in the section below.
